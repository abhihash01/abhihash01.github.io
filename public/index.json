But there is not place I keep it in an organised form. I learn a concept, apply, move on and then days later, I forget and try to scramble to get to the same resources that helped me build my concepts.\nHence I decided to make a central note repository of all the new concepts I learn. Whats a better way of accountability than to publish it at a central place. Hence the birth of this website.\nGoing forward, trying to take time out of my hectic schedule, I aim to continuously update stuff, mostly on Data Science, in an incremental curriculum manner, so anyone wanting to learn a concept like i did, can benefit the best.\nReach out to me for collaborations : abhihash01@gmail.com\n","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/tags/abhilash/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Abhilash"},{"body":"","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/tags/featured/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Featured"},{"body":"","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/tags/profile/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Profile"},{"body":"","link":"https://abhihash01.github.io/categories/profile/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Profile"},{"body":"FNU ABHILASH Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of corporate experience, currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Data Science, and specializing in Generative AI, advanced NLP, CV, and recommendation systems.\nüìß abhihash01@gmail.com | üíº (https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhilash29998/) | üêô (https://github.com/abhihash01) | üåê https://abhihash01.github.io\nSkills Languages: Python, C/C++, Java ML/DL Tools: PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Scikit, OpenCV, Pandas, Seaborn, CNN, RNN, LSTM, XGBoost, CatBoost Concepts: Data modeling, Statistical modeling, Regression, Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Reinforcement Learning Generative AI: Langchain, LLamaindex, Ollama, Deepspeed, Torchtune, GAN, VAE, Diffusion, PEFT, QLoRA, RAG, Mixture of Experts (MoE), CoT/ Prompt Tuning, SFT, DPO, PPO, LLM Fine Tuning, RAG, CUDA, High Performance Computing, vLLM,OpenAI/Gemini API Ops: Docker, Kafka, Kubernates, Spring Boot, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Selenium, JIRA, Postman, Matlab, R, SAS, A/B Testing Data: Spark, PySpark, Hadoop, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Snowflake, Airflow, MLFlow, AWS, GCP, Sagemaker, Looker, PowerBI Experience SAP Machine Learning Engineer Bangalore, India | Jun 2021 - Aug 2023\nDeveloped a NLP based Biz Text Intelligence Model with NLTK and spaCy achieving 72% case coverage.
