Hi, I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of corporate experience, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science, and specializing in Generative AI, advanced NLP, CV, and recommendation systems.

One day while on my Research Assistant job, cramming through a set of research papers trying to understand a specific concept and come up with new ideas, I realised, I have a trail of knowledge that I am gaining through these search. But there is not place I keep it in an organised form. I learn a concept, apply, move on and then days later, I forget and try to scramble to get to the same resources that helped me build my concepts. 

Hence I decided to make a central note repository of all the new concepts I learn. Whats a better way of accountability than to publish it at a central place. Hence the birth of this website. 

Going forward, trying to take time out of my hectic schedule, I aim to continuously update stuff, mostly on Data Science, in an incremental curriculum manner, so anyone wanting to learn a concept like i did, can benefit the best.
