## **Experience**
### SAP
#### *Machine Learning Engineer*
Bangalore, India | Jun 2021 - Aug 2023

- Developed a NLP based Biz Text Intelligence Model with NLTK and spaCy achieving 72% case coverage. Added Sentence Transformers for Intent Detection, increasing coverage to 94%, covering both rule based and natural conversation cases.
- Built a multi email based automatic email responder with contrastive learning using a pooled Transformers + CNN architecture and extractive summarizers achieving 0.67 ROUGE-L score on generation, 0.24 MAE and 0.87 NDCG for recommendation.
- Authored a product wide feature engineering library for 4 history use cases and implemented the Lead and Opportunity scoring model. The model provides scores along with what feature influences, enabling flexible strategy and model explainability.
- Lead a team for the migration of 8 ML use cases from SAP MLF to SAP AI Core directly impacting a revenue increase of $3.4M.
- Communicated with consumers and stakeholders to understand business requirements and spearheaded product roadmaps.
- Tech: Transformers, Catboost, PyTorch, Keras, Docker, Kubernates, AWS, Cloud Foundry, NLTK, Spacy,Spring Boot, Java.

### **Samsung Research Institute**
#### *Data Intelligence Trainee*
Bangalore, India | Jan 2020 - Jul 2020

- Developed an end-to-end system for processing Big Data and created a mobile application recommender system with Deep
Autoencoders. Deployed the model with Django and created a python package for the tool. The model achieved P@K score of 0.83
- Designed a Device Prediction project with user data to predict the device with usage statistics hitting 84% accuracy. Implemented CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and other different Boosting methods. Tech stack PySpark,Keras, Pytorch, Django, Tensorflow.

### **Jones Lang LaSalle(JLL)**
#### *Data Engineer(LaSalle Investment Management)*
Bangalore, India | Aug 2020 ‚Äì June 2021

- Consolidated data into Snowflake warehouse with snowpipes and used Snowflake sql for processing for a $5M ETL digitisation
- Integrated Looker with lookML and sql as well as PowerBI to build real time reporting metrics for different investment vehicles

## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**
### **Graduate Research Assistant**
#### *MedAn: A Framework for Investigating Live Medical Data against Privacy Laws*
Stony Brook, New York | Dec 2023 - Present

**MedAn: A Framework for Investigating Live Medical Data against Privacy Laws**
- Building methods for deriving privacy properties from technical specs using semantic NLP, LLM/SLM Fine tuning, CoT and MoEs

**Medical Visual Question Answering with Vision Language Models**
- Building a vision language model for Oncology Visual Question answering along with building an in house oncology VQA dataset.
- Developed routines to distributedly train large VLMs on a mixed in house HPC cluster consisting of NVIDIA H100s and DGX A100s using flash attention on Deepspeed. The model performs with 86% accuracy on closed and 77% recall on open VQA.
- Created a novel evaluation framework for the NLG evaluation of VLM by fine tuning LLM representations, achieving 0.82
correlation with existent scores on public med VQA datasets and a 68% coverage on all failure cases of existent metrics.
